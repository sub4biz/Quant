# Quant

Quant is an open-source desktop market terminal for tracking ETFs and stocks. It combines a reorderable watchlist, holdings-driven news, earnings context, annotated charts, macro overlays, causal setup-specific signal validation, an authoritative 1D Signal Desk, local probabilistic forecasts, an evidence-backed decision journal, and a verified Quant AI harness.

The core promise is simple: useful market context without paid API lock-in. Quant runs with public market data sources and deterministic signal analysis, can connect to a private llama.cpp server, or interface with an optional OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, or Claude account. No cloud LLM API key is required for the default experience.

## What Quant Does

Quant is built for rapid, disciplined market scanning and evidence-backed decision making:

- **Watchlist Workspace:** Track, reorder (drag & drop or `Alt + Arrow`), and remove ETFs and stocks in a persistent desktop watchlist.
- **Holdings Expansion:** Expand major ETF holdings into a broader market universe with real-time price changes.
- **Holdings News & Earnings:** Read curated news alongside upcoming earnings estimates, surprises, and reporting schedules.
- **Cross-Asset Market Pulse:** 5-state committed regime engine, 90-session correlation matrices, and rate/oil/volatility shock analyzers.
- **Causal Candlestick Charting:** Interactive multi-interval candlestick charts with automatic swing pivots, dynamic support/resistance channels, and risk-reward plans.
- **Signal Board & Scanner:** End-of-day scanner over a curated U.S. universe with instant filtering by **`🟢 Buy Candidates`**, **`🔴 Short Candidates`**, Cup bases, MA alignments, 52W highs, VCP contractions, volume surges, and relative strength leaders. Synthetic fallback candles are excluded from rankings.
- **Authoritative 1D Signal Desk (V2):** Exact-setup causal classification delivering honest `BUY CANDIDATE`, `SHORT CANDIDATE`, `WAIT`, and `NO TRADE` decisions with transparent no-trade blocker explanations.
- **Setup-Specific Historical Replay:** Lookahead-free 5-year daily replay modeling next-open entries, 5 bps slippage, pre-entry gap invalidations, same-bar stop priorities, and 10-bar timeout exits.
- **Statistical Confidence Intervals:** Deterministic 95% bootstrap intervals on expectancy $R$ and 95% Wilson score intervals on positive trade rates.
- **Forward Outcome Tracker:** Persistent forward signal recording (`quant-signal-outcomes-v1.json`) that resolves observed signals against subsequent daily bars.
- **Macro Overlays:** Toggle jobs, unemployment, CPI, 10Y Treasury yield, crude oil, and VIX directly on price charts.
- **Local Probabilistic Forecasts:** Run 24-trading-hour Kronos-mini time-series forecasts with 30 sampled paths and projected MA20 continuations.
- **Evidence-Backed Decision Journal:** Save local thesis snapshots with immutable evidence items (E1–E5), quality audits, and trade plans.
- **Verified Quant AI Desk:** Deterministic rule verifier paired with optional local llama.cpp or cloud LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, Claude).

## What's New in v2.2.0 — Correctness & Repository Hardening

v2.2.0 is deliberately a reliability release rather than a feature expansion:

- **Correct price structure:** breakout and failed-breakout levels come from bars that were already closed when the setup formed.
- **Live-only market rankings:** deterministic sample candles can preserve offline chart UX but cannot enter Signal Board rankings.
- **Truthful coverage:** the default scanner is labeled **Curated U.S.** and reports attempted, successfully scanned, and unavailable names.
- **Forward-record integrity:** pruning and first/last timestamps remain chronological even after the store is reordered.
- **Cleaner source tree:** generated `dist/` output is ignored, and forecast implementation documents live under `docs/forecast/`.
- **One-command baseline:** `npm run verify` runs type checking, core tests, Signal V2 regressions, and the production build.

## What's New in v2.1.0 — Quant Signal Engine V2

Quant v2.1.0 introduced **Quant Signal Engine V2**, overhauling the legacy generic rule score and unrelated breakout backtest with a causal, setup-specific, execution-aware signal system.

```

```

### Key V2 Features:

- **Signal Board Candidate Filters:** Screen the market universe directly for `🟢 Buy Candidates` and `🔴 Short Candidates` with live Setup Quality scores (`quality 82/100`) and candidate badges.
- **Causal Setup-Specific Historical Validation:** Replaced legacy breakout backtests with strict, lookahead-free replay across 5 years of daily history for the exact setup and direction.
- **Execution Simulator with Realistic Friction:** Next-open entry, 5 bps slippage, pre-entry gap invalidations (`gap-invalidated`, `gap-beyond-target`, `rr-invalidated`), conservative same-bar stop priority, and 10-bar timeout exits.
- **Bootstrap & Wilson Confidence Intervals:** Deterministic `mulberry32` PRNG bootstrap 95% CI on expectancy $R$ and 95% Wilson score CI on win rate.
- **Persistent Forward Outcome Store:** Automatically logs live candidate emissions to `quant-signal-outcomes-v1.json` and evaluates trade resolution over subsequent daily bars.
- **AI Evidence Ledger (V2):** Immutable numbered evidence snapshots (E1–E5) supplying setup-specific replay and forward metrics to the Quant AI analyst and verifier.

## What's New in v2.0.0 — Local Probabilistic Forecasting

New:

- **Forecast any ticker:** Run a local 24-trading-hour probabilistic forecast.
- **Clear progress:** See a measured ETA while forecasting, or cancel the run.
- **Chart overlay:** Toggle the median path and P10–P90 sampled range.
- **Projected MA20:** Optionally continue the chart’s MA20 through forecast-median closes.
- **Saved forecasts:** Reopen each run for seven days and compare it with observed closes.
- **Right-click and delete:** Remove a stock or ETF directly from the watchlist.
- **Drag and reorder:** Click, hold, and move watchlist entries; their order is saved.
- **Keyboard friendly:** Press Escape to close charts and Alt + Arrow to reorder entries.
- **Native packaging:** Forecast support ships inside the macOS ARM64 and Windows x64 apps.

### Forecast Demo

Click the preview to watch the 12-second demo:

[![Watch the Quant v2.0 forecast demo](./docs/assets/demos/quant-v2-forecast-demo.png)](./docs/assets/demos/quant-v2-forecast-demo.mp4)

### How the Forecast Works

- **Input:** Up to 360 completed hourly price and volume bars.
- **Model:** The local Kronos-mini time-series model generates 30 independent paths.
- **Result:** Quant shows the median path, sampled P10–P90 range, upside frequency, and volatility diagnostics.
- **MA20 option:** A dashed continuation derives from chart closes plus forecast medians; it does not change Kronos inputs.
- **Horizon:** 24 future trading-hour bars, usually about four U.S. market sessions.
- **History:** Every successful run is saved as an immutable snapshot for seven days.
- **Limits:** It is not a chat LLM and does not use news, earnings, macro releases, or unexpected events.

### Introduced in v1.5.0

- Market Regime Engine v2 classifies healthy uptrend, correction, oversold bounce, distribution/downtrend, and recession-defense conditions.
- Raw evidence must persist for two completed sessions before the committed regime changes; pending transitions remain visible in the interface.
- Every regime result carries a versioned methodology, data-health status, source-backed evidence ledger, decline attribution, warnings, and deterministic verification checks.
- The chart workspace includes MA20/50/200, log scale, Fit/Latest navigation, keyboard range shortcuts, and a collapsible state-preserving inspector.

### Introduced in v1.4.0

- New Market Pulse workspace for broad market state without copying the visual overload of institutional terminals.
- Transparent 0-100 regime score built from equity trend, breadth, volatility stability, and defensive demand.
- Six-asset monitor covering SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, GLD, and USO with momentum, realized volatility, and SMA20 state.
- 90-session cross-asset correlation matrix and adjustable rates, oil, and volatility scenario analyzer.
- Uses Quant's existing public Yahoo chart path and explicit `SAMPLE` fallback; no new API key is required.

### Introduced in v1.3.1

- Fixed a Settings-page crash when enabling local llama.cpp.
- Hardened the provider endpoint and model inputs against the same deferred React event-lifetime failure.

### Introduced in v1.3.0

- Dedicated Quant AI Settings tab with local llama.cpp, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, and Claude provider profiles.
- Real connection testing for endpoint, authentication, and model configuration.
- OS-encrypted cloud API-key storage that never returns saved credentials to the renderer.
- The full provider setup is also available during first-run onboarding.
- Multi-chart 1M, 3M, and 1Y controls now reload and rebuild every pane with the correct candle series.

### Introduced in v1.2.1

- Market News and its symbol filter rail are now strictly contained within the center workspace and cannot paint over the Earnings pane.
- Long headlines and previews shrink and wrap within the owning grid column.

### Introduced in v1.2.0

- Evidence-Backed Signal Desk with explicit chart, strategy, backtest, earnings, and valuation provenance.
- Local Decision Journal with planned, active, invalidated, and closed states.
- Verified Quant AI harness: isolated analyst and verifier workers followed by bounded orchestration.
- Numbered evidence citations, output validation, worker timing, failure attribution, and deterministic fallback.
- Local model defaults aligned with the `gemma-4-e4b-it` llama.cpp runtime.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release notes.

## Try It

There are two practical ways to try Quant.

### Option 1: Download a Release Build

Download the platform archive from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/eisenjimmy/Quant/releases), then extract it.

macOS:

```bash
open Quant-v2.0.0-mac-arm64/Quant.app
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\Quant-v2.0.0-win-x64\Quant.exe
```

The source repository contains no packaged binaries. Release ZIPs are published as GitHub Release assets, keeping ordinary clones small and avoiding Git LFS downloads.

If macOS blocks the unsigned app, open System Settings and allow the app after the first blocked launch. The app is ad-hoc signed for local use but not Apple-notarized.

### Option 2: Run From Source

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Git
- Python 3.10–3.12 to enable local forecasts from source
- macOS or Windows
- Internet access for live public market data

macOS or Linux shell:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eisenjimmy/Quant.git
cd Quant
npm start quant
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/eisenjimmy/Quant.git
cd Quant
npm start quant
```

`npm start quant` and `npm start` run the same self-healing startup:

- Install locked Node dependencies when they are missing or the lockfile changes.
- Initialize the pinned Kronos submodule when needed.
- Prepare and verify the local forecast environment when Python 3.10–3.12 is available.
- Build Quant and launch the Electron app.
- Skip repeated installs after the environment is current.

The core terminal still launches if forecast setup is unavailable and prints
one actionable warning. Use `npm start -- --skip-forecast` to intentionally
skip Python setup, or `npm start -- --refresh` to recheck all dependencies.
Startup updates dependencies from the committed lockfiles; it never runs
`git pull` or changes the checked-out source branch.

## Screenshots

### First-Run Onboarding

The onboarding wizard helps a new user choose a starter watchlist, configure local llama.cpp or an optional cloud provider, test the connection, and understand the basic reading flow.

![Quant onboarding wizard](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-onboarding.png)

### Market Dashboard

The main screen keeps the app dense and practical: watchlist on the left, holdings-driven news in the center, and earnings context on the right.

![Quant dashboard](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-dashboard.png)

### Market Pulse

The Market Pulse tab turns the most useful ideas from dense institutional terminals into one ordered workflow: **committed market regime → source evidence → cross-asset relationships → shock sensitivity**. Its score is deterministic and decomposable, every asset preserves live/sample provenance, and the scenario output is labeled as relative sensitivity rather than a return forecast.

The current monitor uses SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, GLD, and USO alongside public FRED labor/rate series and Yahoo VIX data. The regime engine keeps separate raw and committed states, requiring two completed sessions of agreement before a transition. The correlation matrix aligns the latest 90 daily return observations, while the scenario analyzer lets users stress rates, oil, and volatility without implying broker execution or options-flow coverage that Quant does not possess.

The regime model is an independent Quant implementation conceptually informed by the ARDS-X methodology in Dennis Kim's [`vibe-investing`](https://github.com/gameworkerkim/vibe-investing) repository. Quant does not copy ARDS-X confidence claims, and its evidence-strength score is explicitly not a calibrated probability or return forecast.

### Signal Board

The Signal Board turns daily candles into a compact scanner view. Quant runs deterministic pattern rules across the selected universe, ranks matching symbols, and labels each row with signal tags such as `Cup`, `MA alignment`, `Near high`, `VCP`, `MACD`, and `RS strong`.

![Quant Signal Board feature banner](./docs/assets/showcase/quant-signal-board-banner.png)

Today the scanner covers the app's bundled U.S. stock directory plus optional watchlist/ETF modes. The API boundary is intentionally separated from the UI so a production bulk end-of-day feed can replace the bundled universe when full-market coverage is required.

### Chart Modal and Signal Desk

Opening a symbol brings up the full chart workspace: candlesticks, volume, pivots, risk levels, deterministic signal scoring, evidence provenance, valuation context, earnings context, and the local Decision Journal. The workspace keeps the current canvas visible while ranges load, preserves each inspector tab's state, and exposes Fit/Latest keyboard navigation for quick recovery after zooming or panning.

Price studies include MA20, MA50, MA200, and a proportional log scale. Macro context is deliberately presented as one selectable lens on an independent mini-scale so unlike units never distort the equity price axis. The inspector can collapse into a full-width chart without discarding an in-progress AI memo or journal entry.

![Quant chart modal](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-chart-modal.png)

### Local Probabilistic Forecasts

Open any ticker, select **Forecast**, and choose **Run Forecast**. Quant runs
Kronos-mini locally, validates the 30 sampled paths, and displays the median
plus sampled P10–P90 range on the chart.

- The 24-bar horizon follows trading hours, skipping overnight periods, weekends, holidays, and early-close gaps.
- On 1M–1Y chart ranges, **Project MA20 through forecast** continues the visible MA20 as a dashed derived overlay.
- Each rerun creates a separate seven-day snapshot; earlier forecasts are never overwritten.
- **Historical comparison** aligns available observed closes with the original forecast timestamps.
- Forecasts are experimental sampled data, not calibrated certainty or investment advice.

### News at Each Swing

Quant detects swing highs and swing lows, numbers the key points, and groups headlines published around each swing. The goal is to make price movement explainable: a user can click through the swing list and compare chart pivots against the news available near that date.

![Quant news at each swing](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-swing-news.png)

### Macro Overlay System

Quant can place one macro lens in an independent chart band. This is useful when a setup depends on rates, labor data, inflation, oil, volatility, or broad risk appetite. Restricting the chart to one macro unit at a time keeps the comparison legible without changing the equity price scale.

![Quant macro overlays](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-macro-overlays.png)

Available chart overlays:

| Overlay | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| Jobs | Frames economic momentum and sector rotation risk |
| Unemployment | Helps identify labor-cycle stress or late-cycle cooling |
| CPI | Connects inflation pressure to rates, margins, and multiples |
| 10Y yield | Acts as a discount-rate anchor for equity and ETF valuation |
| Oil | Affects energy, transport, inflation, and consumer-margin pressure |
| VIX | Shows market fear, expected volatility, and stop-width regime |
| Risk | Draws entry, stop, target, and position sizing context |

### Verified Quant AI Harness

Quant AI is a dedicated chart tab. It locks a numbered evidence ledger from the current symbol, signal evaluation, risk plan, pivot-linked news, earnings, valuation, and active macro overlays. A clean analyst context writes a provisional memo, an isolated verifier independently audits the same evidence, and a bounded orchestrator reconciles both into the final cited response. The UI exposes the stages, timing, evidence quality, validation checks, and fallbacks.

![Quant AI agent tab](./docs/assets/screenshots/quant-ai-agent.png)

## Quant AI Provider Setup

Quant AI does not require a paid cloud model provider. Open the **Settings** tab—or use the same setup during onboarding—to choose one active inference provider for the analyst, isolated verifier, and final orchestrator.

Available modes and providers:

| Provider | Default endpoint | Default model | Credential |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic fallback | None | Rules engine | None |
| Local llama.cpp | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` | `gemma-4-e4b-it` | None |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `sol-high` | OpenAI API key |
| Google Gemini | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` | `gemini-3.5-flash` | Gemini API key |
| xAI Grok | `https://api.x.ai/v1` | `grok-4.3` | xAI API key |
| Anthropic Claude | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Anthropic API key |

### Local llama.cpp

Start a llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible server:

```bash
llama-server -m /path/to/model.gguf --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Quant uses:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Example local setup:

```bash
export QUANT_LLM_ENABLED=1
export QUANT_LLM_PROVIDER=local
export QUANT_LLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
export QUANT_LLM_MODEL=gemma-4-e4b-it
npm start
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:QUANT_LLM_ENABLED="1"
$env:QUANT_LLM_PROVIDER="local"
$env:QUANT_LLM_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
$env:QUANT_LLM_MODEL="gemma-4-e4b-it"
npm start
```

### Cloud credentials

Cloud API keys are optional. Quant encrypts saved keys using Electron `safeStorage`, backed by the operating system's credential protection. Keys stay in the Electron main process, are never returned to the UI after saving, and are sent only to the configured provider endpoint. If secure encryption is unavailable, Quant refuses to save the key in plaintext.

The **Test connection** action sends a minimal completion to verify the current endpoint, key, and model before the configuration is used by the harness.

![Generated Quant AI showcase](./docs/assets/showcase/quant-ai-showcase.png)

## Data Sources

Quant uses free public endpoints and bundled fallback data:

- Yahoo Finance chart, quote, search, valuation, and earnings endpoints
- Yahoo Finance RSS feeds
- Google News RSS
- FRED CSV endpoints for selected macro overlays
- Bundled sample chart, holdings, quote, news, and earnings data

No API key is required for the default experience.

Important limitations:

- Public endpoints can change, throttle, or fail.
- Data can be delayed, approximate, incomplete, or unavailable.
- Free endpoints should not be treated as trading infrastructure.
- `SAMPLE` badges mean bundled fallback data is being shown instead of live data.
- Sample candles are for graceful offline chart fallback only; they never enter Signal Board rankings.

## Architecture

Quant uses a standard Electron split:

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main process | `src/main` | Fetches remote data, owns persistent stores, handles IPC, opens external URLs |
| Preload bridge | `src/main/preload.ts` | Exposes a typed, narrow `window.quant` API to the renderer |
| Shared types | `src/shared` | IPC contracts, market data models, deterministic signal engine |
| Renderer | `src/renderer` | React UI, chart rendering, app state, onboarding, agent UI |
| Forecast worker | `forecast-engine` | Local Kronos inference, path validation, aggregation, and protocol-safe progress |
| Build scripts | `scripts` | Build, tests, smoke screenshots, release packaging |

The renderer does not directly call remote market endpoints. It asks the Electron main process through the preload bridge. That keeps network access, filesystem writes, local LLM calls, and external link opening in the main process.

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |

## Kronos Forecast Setup

Kronos Forecast is experimental and runs only after **Run Forecast** is
pressed. Opening Quant, selecting a ticker, or opening a chart does not start
Python, load Kronos, fetch forecast history, or download model files.

For development:

```bash
npm run setup:forecast
npm run typecheck
npm run test:quant
```

For the complete host release gate, install PyInstaller, run
`npm run build:forecast-sidecar` on a supported native host, then run
`npm run check:forecast`. The gate launches the real frozen worker for a health
exchange and drives the actual built renderer in headless Chrome. Set
`CHROME_PATH` if Chrome is not installed in its standard location.

The first real forecast downloads the immutable
`NeoQuasar/Kronos-mini` and `NeoQuasar/Kronos-Tokenizer-2k` snapshots. Their
safetensor weights total about 32 MB. Quant verifies the pinned revision, file
size, and SHA-256 before loading them; model weights are cached outside the app
and are not included in release ZIPs.

Runtime device behavior:

- CPU is supported and is the fallback, but a 30-path forecast can be slow and
  has no guaranteed completion-time benchmark.
- CUDA is selected automatically when PyTorch reports it available.
- Apple MPS is selected automatically when available.
- MPS and CUDA remain experimental and unbenchmarked. A device failure during a
  run does not silently retry on another device.
- Forecast output is experimental sampled data, not calibrated certainty or
  investment advice.

## Release Packaging

Quant includes a lightweight release packager at `scripts/package-release.mjs`. It does not require electron-builder.

The packager:

1. Requires the matching, previously built forecast sidecar.
2. Runs `scripts/build.mjs`.
3. Uses the installed Electron runtime, or downloads the matching official Electron runtime into `.release-cache/` if the local runtime is missing.
4. Creates a minimal Electron app payload under `resources/app`.
5. Copies the compiled `dist/` payload and native forecast sidecar.
6. Copies Quant and Kronos licenses plus `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
7. Produces runnable release folders and distributable ZIP archives under the locally ignored `release/` directory.

Build each sidecar on its native target host. PyInstaller does not
cross-compile:

```bash
# Apple Silicon macOS
.forecast-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r forecast-engine/requirements-packaging.txt
npm run build:forecast-sidecar -- --platform=darwin --arch=arm64
npm run package:mac

# 64-bit Windows
.\.forecast-venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r forecast-engine\requirements-packaging.txt
npm run build:forecast-sidecar -- --platform=win32 --arch=x64
npm run package:win
```

The generated sidecars live under ignored `sidecars/darwin-arm64` and
`sidecars/win32-x64` folders. A packaging job may consume a sidecar artifact
built on the other native host.

Build both release folders:

```bash
npm run package:all
```

Outputs:

```text
release/Quant-v2.2.0-mac-arm64/Quant.app
release/Quant-v2.2.0-mac-arm64.zip
release/Quant-v2.2.0-win-x64/Quant.exe
release/Quant-v2.2.0-win-x64.zip
```

The version is embedded in both the release folder and archive name so a new package never silently replaces the previous release.

Upload the ZIP archives as GitHub Release assets. Do not distribute `Quant.exe` alone because it depends on adjacent Electron runtime files.

Local macOS packages receive only ad-hoc signing. Public macOS distribution
still requires a Developer ID signature and notarization. Windows packages are
not code-signed by this script and require a separate signing step before
public distribution.

On machines where global `node`/`npm` is unavailable but a working Electron runtime exists, the scripts can be run through Electron's Node mode:

```bash
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 /path/to/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron scripts/package-release.mjs --platform=darwin,win32
```

## Troubleshooting

### `npm start` opens no window in VS Code on Windows

Some VS Code terminals set `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, which can make Electron behave like Node instead of launching a window.

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run build
& ".\node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe" .
```

### Local LLM cannot connect

Check the local model server:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

Then confirm the environment variables are set in the same shell that launches Quant.

To reopen onboarding:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/electron . --onboarding
```

To reset saved LLM preferences, remove `llm-settings.json` from Electron's `userData` directory and launch Quant again.

## Security Model

- Renderer loads local app files.
- Content Security Policy blocks arbitrary remote connections from the renderer.
- Main process validates external URLs before opening them.
- Market data and news are treated as untrusted remote content.
- Local LLM calls are disabled by default.
- No secrets are required for default operation.
- Treat market output as informational context, not execution advice.
